so... it looks like it's been a while. *ahem*



i just went through our digital pics from the past couple months and picked out some good ones to put up. and, like a good parent of two children. i picked 16 for andrew's section and 16 for camryn's. i'm pretty sure camryn wouldn't protest if it had been uneven. but i feel better inside this way.



otherwise, i've been busy, but we've made it one year deeper into this new millenium. rejoice.
