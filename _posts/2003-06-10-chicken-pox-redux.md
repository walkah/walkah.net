so, now that andrew is done with chicken pox and back in school... guess who's covered in spots? yup. camryn's got the pox.  but at least she's young enough that they don't seem to bother her... and she can't quite scratch them yet.



in other news... chad was up from atlanta on the weekend (with his new girlfriend raven). we had tons of fun. we even went to canada's wonderland for the first time in years.  naturally, i totally forgot my camera, so the memories are entirely in our heads. neener neener. :p
