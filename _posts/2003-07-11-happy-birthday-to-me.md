so, yesterday i turned 26... on what seemed to be a gloomy, rainy work day.  they say patience is a virtue, well i just needed to wait yesterday. 'cause after work, sandi and i had a wonderful dinner - "grown-up time" - and she gave me new shoes! (i've had footwear issues for some time, so yes that is a big deal for me).



the other big news is that when we got home, i discovered that we actually *finally* had grass in our backyard! (it only took 14 months!)  so now perhaps, i should take a set of completed house pictures.
