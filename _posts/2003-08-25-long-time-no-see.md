so, it's been well over a month. so much has happened... we've been to rockport and back. had a great trip despite the rain. there are pictures that will appear in the <a href="http://gallery.walkah.net">gallery</a> at some point. 

the big news, however, is that camryn has started to take steps on her own! she can do about 3 or 4 steps before collapsing in a fit of giggles in your arms.  it's great fun.
