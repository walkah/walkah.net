<p>so as many of you may know... i've had a pretty long-standing lust for apple hardware. i also have never owned a laptop. well, recently i decided to kill two birds with one stone and order a <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/powerbook/index12.html">12" powerbook</a> from apple. well, i got a nice little surprise today when a shipping confirmation e-mail landed in my inbox along with a fedex tracking number :)</p><p>

i'm giddy with anticipation. also excited to be able to do all kinds of macosx hacking and perhaps play with linux-ppc. yay!!!</p>
