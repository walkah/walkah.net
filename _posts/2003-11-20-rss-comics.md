i used to *really* like reading comics. and, while i know most comics are available online, actually browsing each comic site is a bit too time consuming... especially if you haven't bookmarked them well. (actually makes a sunday paper seem like a good idea). anyway, the online answer has arrived... you can subscribe to rss feeds for your favourite comics at using <a href="http://dwlt.net/tapestry/">tapestry</a>. this of course makes the most sense if you're using an RSS aggregator such as <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> (on Mac OSX) or <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/straw/">straw</a> for GNOME.
