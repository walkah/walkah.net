<a href="http://www.alexking.org/blog">alex king</a> has a really good idea on his blog about having an API for centralized rss feed subscriptions, etc. including tracking which articles have been read. i, for one, think this is a great idea. since i tend to move back and forth between computers (and operating systems), i've taken to doing most of my RSS reading with <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/netnewswire">NetNewsWire</a> on my powerbook.
this solution, however, would allow me to use <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/straw/">straw</a> more. which means i might be inclined to hack on it. hopefully this idea doesn't go the way of the dodo, and alex and <a href="http://feedster.com/">feedster</a> can work out a solution.
