i'm just not quite on the ball with this whole blogging thing quite yet. reading around the web... there are actually people who posted new years wishes on new years day! well. it's the 5th and here's mine. i never really make new years resolutions... but i'm planning on 2004 being a big year for me personally. i'll probably post more specifically as i go.. but i intend to increase my involvement in various free software projects (particularly drupal and gallery to start), but i'd also like to really do some <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">gnome</a> hacking and write some software for my mac. i'm looking forward to having a great year with my family... it looks like we may even take our first *real* family vacation.
the dreams are big for 2004 :)
