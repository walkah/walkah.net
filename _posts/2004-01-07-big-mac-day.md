<p>so yesterday was apple's big <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/mwsf04/">macworld</a> keynote by steve jobs... and for the first year, i actually watched it. i haven't sat through too many keynote-type industry things.. though i did see linus torvalds give one in person (which was cool), but i have to say... apple knows how to put on a show.</p>

<p>anyway, it's inspired me to add a quick little note to my apple category.</p>

<p>i finally broke down and ordered more ram from <a href="http://www.crucial.com/">crucial</a> a week ago or so. It arrived monday... and my powerbook is *much* happier.</p>

<p>i also want to post some thoughts on my <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod">iPod</a> here, but overall i really love it. Too bad the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodmini">iPod mini</a> isn't that impressive (or at least a bit cheaper).</p>

<p>what was cool about yesterday's keynote was the look at <a href="http://www.apple.com/hardware/video/virginiatech/">vatech's cluster</a>.</p>

<p>i also thought the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife</a> updates looked promising.. but no more free iPhoto downloads sucks, though <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband">Garageband</a> might actually make me fork over the $49usd anyway. :P</p>
