so, on very short, last-minute type notice, i ended up attending andrew's first ever ski trip today with his school. while i didn't end up skiing myself (rather spent the day manning the 'lift' and the line on the beginner hill) but andrew had an absolute blast. looks like we're gonna be hittin' the slopes on a semi-regular basis, if he has his way.
now, i just need to find a nice quiet hill with nobody on it to see if i can still remember how to ski :P  i'm sure it's "just like riding a bike".
