so, after briefly flirting with a fixed width design, i've got back a "fluid" layout for this site. thanks mainly to peter at <a href="http://openflows.org/">openflows</a> for some <a href="http://www.humanfactors.com/downloads/oct02.asp#bobbailey">good</a> <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2003/12/15/fixedorliquid.htm">articles</a> on the merits of liquid layouts. i've personally come to the conclusion that both approaches have their own merits, and as usual it's a matter of fitting the design to the application. that said, this blog (imo) looks better liquid - too damned much white space otherwise. besides, not enough people read it to really make a difference ;)
as an interesting aside... i also dug up <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/elastic/">this article</a> discussing "elastic" design (a sort of compromise). looks like an interesting 3rd party.
