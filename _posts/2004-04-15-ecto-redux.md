so, i was contacted the other night by <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/blog/">adriaan tijsseling</a> , the author of the <a href="http://walkah.net/node/view/42">aforementioned</a> <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/ecto/">ecto</a> - a stellar blogging app for os x. he reported a <a href="http://drupal.org/node/view/7163">small bug</a> in drupal's blogapi.module (which i've since fixed).

however, it's also led me to revisit using ecto for blogging... and as you can see by today's flurry of posts - i'm liking it a lot. :) congrats to adriaan on a great bit of software - i highly recommend it!
