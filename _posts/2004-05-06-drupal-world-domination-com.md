man, it's been a crazy couple of weeks. there are some really <a href="http://www.civicspace.org/">interesting</a> <a href="http://www.peopleaggregator.com/">projects</a> (and a couple others that i can't yet link to) out there that are committing to <a href="http://www.drupal.org/">drupal</a> .  the really exciting part is that, for whatever reason, <a href="http://blogs.it/0100198/2004/04/26.html#a2645">some people</a>  have decided that i'm a <a href="http://devel.peopleaggregator.com/DrupalGods">drupal god</a>. well, i'm completely flattered (though, the real deity in the drupal world is certainly still <a href="http://buytaert.net/">dries</a>). the end result has been getting to meet lots of interesting people and it looks like i'll be working on lots of very exciting projects moving forward.

i'm pretty excited. i've really enjoyed getting involved in the drupal community, there are some outstanding folks involved, and the future is very bright. yay!
