<img src="http://walkah.net/files/first_phone.jpg" alt="me from my t616" align="right" />after a fair bit of delay, i've finally implemented metaWeblog.newMediaObject() in drupal's blogapi.module, and <a href="http://www.natrak.net/">Kjartan</a> was nice enough to commit the patch for me. now i won't have to look at <a href="http://drupal.org/node/view/4878">this nagging little issue</a> anymore, and can move on to add some other functionality. it also means that, when using great tools like <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">ecto</a>, you can upload pictures and stuff directly (ecto even has iPhoto support!).

in the interest of killing two birds with one stone, i've also uploaded a sample picture from my <a href="http://walkah.net/node/view/69">new phone</a>. so, that's me.. in my basement office. right on.
