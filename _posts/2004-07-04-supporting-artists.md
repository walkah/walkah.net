it looks like <a href="http://www.theymightbegiants.com/">they might be giants</a> (of all people) have finally caught on to what (i think) is a positive step toward the future of music distribution. they've opened they're <em>own</em> music store. that's right. owned and operated by the artists. they're selling DRM-free mp3's of a couple albums online - directly. 

<a href="http://ibiblio.org/sbw/blog">blake</a> and i have discussed a couple times, that this would be an awesome outlet for <a href="http://www.netjuke.org/">netjuke</a>.  i hope more and more artists will realize the power they can have with this approach (and i hope that netjuke becomes their platform of choice). it's been a long time since i've listened to any they might be giants... but i think i'll buy an album based on principle. :)
