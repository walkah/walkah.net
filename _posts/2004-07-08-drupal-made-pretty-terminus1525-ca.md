<p>i was digging through some old unread feeds when i came across <a href="http://urlgreyhot.com/drupal/node/view/1902">this post</a> over at urlgreyhot.com. it's rather flattering:</p>

<a href="http://www.terminus1525.ca/"><img src="http://walkah.net/files/terminus-square.png" height="90" width="90" alt="terminus1525.ca" class="left" /></a>
<blockquote>"terminus1525 is a Canadian collaborative work space for young emerging artists. It is perhaps the most visually stunning Drupal design I've seen so far."</blockquote>

<p>besides making me blush, michael's post made me realize a couple things:</p>

<p>first, i've never actually said anything here about my involvement with terminus. i'm the one that hacked and slashed <a href="http://drupal.org/">drupal</a> to pieces to make it look like that (i'm even <a href="http://www.terminus1525.ca/user/view/1">uid #1</a> ;) ). it is one of the more fun and challenging projects i've worked on, and i'm proud to say that i'm involved.</p>

<p>the other thing, though, is i must admit that i didn't actually have anything to do with the actual design of terminus. the real credit goes to the fine folks at <a href="http://www.zincroe.com/">zincroe</a> (specifically <a href="http://www.terminus1525.ca/studio/view/3">jason</a> and <a href="http://www.terminus1525.ca/studio/view/150">luke</a>). they're pretty darned creative guys and fun to work with too :)</p>

<p>so, what are you waiting for? head over to <a href="http://www.terminus1525.ca/">terminus</a>, sign up and post your art!</p>
