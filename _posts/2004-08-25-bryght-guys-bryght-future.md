man, it seems like it's been a long time coming, but the wraps are finally off my newest venture: <a href="http://www.bryght.com/">Bryght</a>. as i am sure most of you already know, i am a <a href="http://www.bryght.com/about/the-team/james">rockstar drupal developer</a>. well, a couple months ago, that status translated into my hooking up with <a href="http://boris.bmannconsulting.com/">boris</a> and discussing the plans of a drupal mass-hosting service that <a href="http://daemon.co.za/">adrian</a> and i had been concocting. while we are still very much in "start up" mode, things are progressing quickly, and i am having a whole lot of fun working with the new gang. since all of our work is based on <a href="http://drupal.org/">drupal</a>, i've been able to work (nearly) full-time on everybody's favourite CMS (or is it CMF?) - and i'm looking forward to doing even more of that in the future.

i now officially have a <a href="http://www.bryght.com/blog/4">work blog</a> as well, so i'll keep my bryght-specific postings over there, but there will of course still be drupal-related posts here as well.

anyway, i encourage you all to head on over and check it out. we'd love feedback (and customers, of course!) ... and if you're a designer, do let us know ;)
