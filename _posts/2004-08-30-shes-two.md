wow, it's hard to believe but our little baby is not much of a baby anymore. camryn turned 2 years old yesterday. "2" seems to be an emotional milestone (for parents anyway). no longer will we refer to camryn's age in months. she's now just 2.

on the bright side, she's as cute as ever, and her second birthday was really fun because she "gets it" now. she sang happy birthday to herself, blew out the candle, and tore threw presents like an old pro. pictures will be forthcoming - i promise!
