although he's at school right now (a problem i never had to worry about growing up - being a july baby), andrew is 7 years (and 11 hours) old!! ya, it blows my mind too. 7 and 2. sheesh.

also, andrew had his evaluation skate for hockey this year, so the season is officially underway - be prepared for updates. extra updates this year, thanks to the stupid <a href="http://www.nhlcbanews.com/">nhl cba</a>.
