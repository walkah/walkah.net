it doesn't happen often, but every once in a while i make an impulse purchase. it happened recently when i was at the grocery store. i don't even remember what i was supposed to be buying now - i think goat's milk - but, as i turned to leave the aisle for the checkout counter, a striking black 1lb coffee bag caught my eye. i paused long enough to read the label. what i'd discovered was <a href="http://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/">kicking horse coffee</a>. a couple things made be decide to buy it: the particular brew is called "kick ass" coffee which i thought was cute, but it also boasts fairly traded, organic beans that are roasted here in canada. "can't beat that", i thought.

this morning marks my first cup of kick ass coffee, and i must say (while i'm no connoisseur), it tastes pretty damned good to me.
