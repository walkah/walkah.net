<p>
consider me officially putting this on my christmas wishlist:
</p><p>
i just noticed over at <a href="http://www.mikedoughty.com/blog/" title="Mike Doughty, former Soul Coughing frontman">mike doughty's blog</a>, that mike has <a href="http://www.mikedoughty.com/blog/archives/000083.html">officially signed with ATO records</a>. in the short term, it means that he's re-releasing skittish as part of a two disc set that will include rockity roll and some songs of <em>evenhand</em> and other goodies. that's awesome news, 'cause i had to download skittish, 'cause i waited too long (until after he'd sold all his copies) to buy myself a copy. though, i bought rockity roll from the man himself (money that went straight to his gas tank, i presume). 
</p><p>
btw, anyone else here think that mike should run a <a href="http://drupal.org/" title="Drupal Content Management">drupal</a>-based community? mike: have your people call <a href="http://www.bryght.com/" title="Bryght hosted community content">my people</a>.
</p>
