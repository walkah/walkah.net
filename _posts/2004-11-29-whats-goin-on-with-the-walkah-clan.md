<p>
there haven't been many family updates here lately, so let me see if i can do a brief recap:
</p><ul>
<li>andrew is just recovering from bronchitis (and what the doctor figured was<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_disease" title="Wikipedia entry for fifth disease"> fifth disease</a>) so he missed his last couple hockey games. which combined with the nhl lockout has left me a sadly depressed man.</li>
<li>camryn was sick too, but (thankfully) not as bad. not fun.</li>
<li>sandi, andrew and i saw <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/incredibles/index.html">the incredibles</a> yesterday. my hat goes off to <a href="http://www.pixar.com/" title="Pixar animation studios">pixar</a> - they've done it <strong>again</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sudden-thoughts.com/" title="charles walker - sudden thoughts">chad</a> is the newest family member to join the mac ghetto - he finally broke down and replaced his old dell laptop with a 12" powerbook. (i wonder who recommended that? ;) ). he is also leaving soon for paris (like france) for grad school. that sucks, but he's talking about keeping a blog - which would be interesting. (maybe he'll go nuts and start the wheels turning on <a href="http://www.sudden-thoughts.com/" title="charles walker - sudden thoughts">sudden thoughts</a> again too).</li>
<li>the holiday season is upon us. the annual christmas tree hunt is happening this weekend, and sandi did some wrapping last night. (yeah she's one of *those*).</li>
</ul>
