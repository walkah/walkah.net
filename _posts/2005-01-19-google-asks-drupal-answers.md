Today <a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html" title="Preventing comment spam">google announced</a> an initiative to combat the "comment spam" currently plaguing the blogosphere (and, in fact, much of the internet). The "solution" (to add rel="nofollow" to all links - to prevent google from indexing the spammer's site) is simple and has some interesting effects as noted by <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/18.html#a9229" title="Microsoft geek blogger">robert scoble</a>. while it's probably not a solution that will completely eliminate the problem, the number of people already behind the initiative is rather impressive. so impressive that I figured <a href="http://drupal.org/" title="drupal content management framework">drupal</a> should join the fray.

So, as of moments ago, drupal also <a href="http://drupal.org/node/15847">supports rel="nofollow"</a> .
