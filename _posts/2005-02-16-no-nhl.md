i've not said much about it, but i'm a huge hockey fan. and about 15 mintues ago, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/who/bettman_gary.html" title="NHL Commissioner">gary bettman</a> announced the <a href="http://tsn.ca/nhl/news_story.asp?ID=115107&hubName=nhl" title="It's Over: Bettman cancels NHL season">2004-5 season is cancelled</a>. it's sad. but, like many fans, i've lived a full and productive year without it. andrew and i have been to see the <a href="http://auroratigers.com/">aurora tigers</a> a couple times, and actually, that's much more fun for us.

goodbye NHL. so long, and thanks for all the... well... see you next year, i presume.
