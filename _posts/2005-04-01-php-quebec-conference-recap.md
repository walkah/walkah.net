i'm back home and rested now after  <a href="http://conf.phpquebec.com/en/" title="PHP Quebec Conference 2005">PHP Quebec</a> - where I did a presentation on <a href="http://drupal.org/" title="drupal content management platform">drupal</a>'s distributed authentication and <a href="http://www.sxip.com/" title="SXIP - Identity 2.0">sxip</a>. i have to admit, i'm still pretty new to the whole conference going / speaking scene - but the time (while short and fast) was enjoyable - thanks to the php quebec organizers for a good show. 
</p><p>
a couple personal highlights : 
</p><ul>
<li>caught <a href="http://www.lerdorf.com" title="Rasmus Lerdorf">rasmus</a>' presentation - he's doing some pretty cool stuff over at yahoo! - and i finally got to shake his hand. rasmus and I are very loosely linked by friends of friends in the toronto area, and yet i've never actually had a chance to meet him (largely 'cause he lives in california).</li>
<li>met <a href="http://www.stevesgallery.com/" title="Steve Mansour">steve mansour</a> - who was doing photography for the conference - and is a big drupal fan. he was nice enough to take this poor little anglophone under his wing. we got to talk a lot about some of the cool stuff he's up to using drupal - he's also heavily into the community wireless scene in montreal. very cool.</li>
<li>turns out, one of steve's good friends is "<a href="http://bopuc.levendis.com/weblog/" title="Boris Anthony">bopuc</a>" - who's path i've crossed via #joiito (and it seems i can't leave the house anymore without having jonas' name come up in conversation these days), so after last night's speaker dinner we met up with boris and grabbed a couple beers. some pretty heavy, and very interesting conversation ensued. oh, and guys - next time you're in the toronto area - beer's on me.</li>
</ul><p>
the one thing i did realize, though, is that despite having used PHP for development since 1997 (is that really 8 years ago?!?!), i've never gotten involved in the PHP community at large. i think that's something i'd like to change - time permitting of course. but there are some pretty cool things going on in the community and some pretty cool folks behind it. hopefully they'll have me back :)
