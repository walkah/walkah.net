been a while since i've done a 'family' post... so much happens, that i need to either write a novel here or just gloss over it for the nuggets that might have mass-web appeal. so here's one:

when <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/">the Boris</a> was in town last weekend, he got sucked into doing chalk drawings on the driveway (one of camryn's favourite pastimes). after running out of things  - he ended up doing a drawing of <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail58.html">trogdor, the burninator</a>. (those of you who don't know <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail.html">strongbad</a> are missing a seriously important part of the internet).
