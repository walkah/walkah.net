while there are a couple other posts I've been meaning to do lately... this little snippet caught my eye and has me all excited this morning. from <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2005/06/20050628065508.shtml">macrumors.com</a>: 
</p><blockquote>
MacRumors confirms that iTunes 4.9 includes messages such as "Phone Preferences", "Configure Phone", and "iPod Phone Prefs".
</blockquote><p>
iTunes 4.9 is currently downloading to my powerbook... and I think I have a new birthday wish (if only it gets released on time...)
