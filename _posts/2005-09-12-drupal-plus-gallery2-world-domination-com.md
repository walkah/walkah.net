<p>so, finally, after months and months - the <a href="http://gallery.sourceforge.net/">gallery project</a> has completed their site migration from it's former mish-mash of phpBB and postnuke to a much sleeker <a href="http://drupal.org/">drupal site</a> (see <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/page/welcome_to_the_new_gallery_website">the full announcement</a> for details).</p>

<p>the other very good news - that visitors of this site might appreciate - is that the new gallery2 drupal site uses the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/gallery" title="Drupal Gallery module">integration code</a> that I wrote originally. This means that, yes, the code has actually been updated to work with the latest version of Gallery2 (RC2).</p>

<p>I also spent some time to fix up <a href="http://walkah.net/gallery">my gallery</a> using this latest code. As you can see, "clean urls" are working again, and the default "matrix" theme for gallery blends in fairly well (with some minor modifications).</p>

<p>Big thanks to <a href="http://www.mediratta.net/">bharat</a> (gallery's mastermind) for cleaning up some of my code to work with the latest G2! And a big congrats to both projects for continuing to produce quality code in spite of my involvement :)</p>
