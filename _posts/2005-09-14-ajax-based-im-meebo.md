<p>just picked this up <a href="http://gigaom.com/2005/09/14/ajax-based-im-meebo/">via Om</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Through Ajax, the folks at meebo were able to create a virtual application-like experience within a single web browsing window. meebo integrates a user’s accounts from AIM, Yahoo Messenger, MSN Messenger, and ICQ into a single buddy list that is automatically populated upon signing into the meebo web site. Sort of like Trillian/Adium, but in a browser window.

<p><a href="http://www.meebo.com/" title="meebo web-based IM">meebo</a>, eh? well, hey guys... how about some <a href="http://www.jabber.org">jabber</a> support? i'd love to see an elegant, in-browser jabber client right about... now. so, <a href="http://blog.meebo.com/?page_id=2" title="meebo staff">folks</a> - how about it?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I just noticed over on the <a href="http://blog.meebo.com/?p=13">meebo blog</a> that they're using <a href="http://gaim.sf.net/">GAIM</a> (libgaim, I presume) to connect to the IM networks:</p>
<blockquote>We use Apache and Linux (CentOS) on the servers, and connect to the networks through Gaim</blockquote>
<p>not only is my request possible, sounds like it's in the works :)</p>
