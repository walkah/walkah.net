even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners_Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee">the man who invented the internet</a> has <a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/blog/4" title="Tim BL's blog">a blog</a>. and while that is pretty cool... i'd just like to point out his choice of <a href="http://drupal.org" title="Drupal PHP CMS">content management systems</a>.

pretty darned flattering if you ask me.
