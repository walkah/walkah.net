<p>it's been quite a while since I blogged anything that wasn't tech-related. i haven't been good about blogging period. so, consider this an attempt to right some wrongs.</p>

<p>i've realized i have a new singer/songwriter obsession. his name is <a href="http://www.masonjennings.com/">mason jennings</a>. if you're someone that's spoken to me in the last few weeks, chances are good i've mentioned him, or told you to check out a song, or perhaps quoted a verse or two. the kids and i even have sing-alongs on the couple songs i've learned to play.</p>

<p>i find it interesting that in my collection of some 15,000 mp3s that certain artists are able to bubble to the top like this. while he's not quite <a href="http://www.mikedoughty.com/">mike doughty</a> in terms of play count, <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/walkah/charts">my last.fm charts</a> will attest to the fact that he's been in heavy rotation.</p>

<p>much to my delight - i discovered that he's actually <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/98819/">playing toronto</a> in september - and on a tuesday night (I can actually go!). so, i'm gonna check it out - who's coming? </p>
