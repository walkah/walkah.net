<p>Just wanted to drop a quick note to say that I'll be in Vancouver next week to help run four days of drupal training. We (<a href="http://www.bryght.com/">Bryght</a>) are helping put on the event with our partners <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com/">Raincity Studios</a>. More info is available in the <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com/training/drupal/november-2006">official announcement</a>.</p>
<p>I'm told there is still space available, so if you're in Vancouver (or willing to travel) and interested in learning more about designing with or developing for drupal, <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com/training/drupal/november-2006">sign up</a>! I'll see you there :)</p>
