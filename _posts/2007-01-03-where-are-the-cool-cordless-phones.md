<p>I just read an interesting post by <a href="http://gigaom.com/author/allanleinwand/">Allan Leinwand</a> over on GigaOm about the lack of cool (and "internet") features on cordless phones. <a href="http://gigaom.com/2007/01/03/bringing-the-net-to-your-home-phone/">He says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Here’s the irony – mobility and Internet features and functions have lured consumers away from using home cordless phones. Could the Internet on your cordless home phone lure you away from your mobile phones?</blockquote>
<p>While I think "the internet" on cordless phones would be a nice feature, most people have easily available internet access in their home from a computer where the interface is much more pleasant (mobile browsing, while really handy when you don't have other options, just isn't ideal). However, there are a *lot* of features standard on most all mobile phones that I would really like to see in cordless phones.</p>
<p>I am <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/im-voiping-vonage">no longer</a> a "mobile only" phone user. Two reasons (yes, I'm glaring at you, <a href="http://rogers.com/">Rogers</a>): first, my reception at home <em>stinks</em>. Second, the rate plans are ridiculously out of whack here in Canada - and just can't compete with <a href="http://www.vonage.ca/">Vonage</a>, et al. But there are lots of things I'd love to have on my home phone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address book syncing. I have a pretty extensive address book (read: anyone that's going to call me that I'm interested in hearing from is in there), including face pictures for most of them. I love that on my cell phone I can glance down and see who is calling in.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.salling.com/Clicker/mac/">Clicker</a> integration. OK, it wouldn't have to be clicker : but I like when the phone rings - having my iTunes automatically pause, perhaps my <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a> status set to "on phone", etc.</li>
<li>Bluetooth headset usage. I have a headset I love, but I can only use it with skype (or my laptop) and my mobile phone.</li> 
</ul>
<p>Essentially, I want my cordless phone to work more like my mobile. I mean ideally, it'd even be the same handset. Perhaps if my mobile had a SIP client that worked with vonage? Although, in the short term, I'd be very willing to shell out for a bluetooth-enabled cordless phone. Why isn't there such a thing?</p>
