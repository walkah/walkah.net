<p>I finally broke down and started playing around with <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> the other night. As chance would have it, I happened to see a reference to the <a href="http://blog.victoriac.net/?p=87">Twitter Updater plugin for Wordpress</a> and thought "hey, that would be an easy drupal module". That's a game I used to play (or at least do something about) much more regularly, however, the stars were aligned (or maybe it's the new glasses). So I threw together a <a href="http://drupal.org/project/twitter">Twitter module for Drupal</a>.</p>
<p>So far, it functions a lot like the wordpress plugin. Each user can use their own twitter account and have their own "format" for the text that gets posted to twitter when they create a new post. When you create content, twitter gets notified.</p>
<p>So if you are a drupal user and a twitter user, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/twitter">check out the module</a> and check out <a href="http://twitter.com/walkah">me on twitter</a>. Enjoy.</p>
