<p><a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/"><img src="http://walkah.net/files/oscms-summit-2007.png" alt="OSCMS Summit 2007" class="right" /></a>In my usual you-heard-it-here-first-fashion, I'd like to be the last to announce the upcoming <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/">OSCMS Summit 2007</a> happening March 22-23rd in Sunnyvale, CA. This is actually the 2nd (annual?) event. While the conference <a href="http://2006.oscms-summit.org/">last year</a> was a success, it was *very* heavily Drupal-based. I'm actually hoping to see a bit more involvement from the other communities this year, and it's looking like that may well happen.</p> 
<p>I'd also like to point out a couple of events that you should attend. The first is a session I have proposed on <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> called: <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/node/268">OpenID : In Drupal core and your CMS too</a>. While I'll mostly be covering the implementation for Drupal, I think it has significant relevance for all content management systems. Now that Microsoft and AOL are behind OpenID, the project is definitely gaining momentum, but the more content management systems that support OpenID the better for the long term success of the protocol as a dominant force in the <a href="http://identity20.com/">Identity 2.0</a> space. So, vote for the session, and come on out :)</p>
<p>The other event is actually not part of the conference itself, but <a href="http://buytaert.net/">Dries</a> and I are teaming up with the <a href="http://lullabot.com">Lullabots</a> and <a href="http://civicspacelabs.org/">Civicspace</a> to present what should be a very informative session on <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/seminar/drupal_performance_and_scalability/sunnyvale_ca_2007">Drupal  Performance and Scalability</a>. It's not a free event, but highly worth it for anyone running a large Drupal installation, and all the proceeds will go back to the Drupal project.</p>
<p>Get yourself signed up and see you there!</p>
