<p>After what feels like years in the making, the <a href="http://association.drupal.org/">Drupal Association</a> is <em>officially</em> up and running and ready for <a href="http://drupal.org/node/122835">public unveiling</a>. I'm pretty honoured to have been selected to be amongst the <a href="http://association.drupal.org/about/staff">great group of people</a> involved.</p>
<p>For those of you who haven't heard, the association has been established to help with funding, infrastructure, promotion, event management, etc. Essentially, we're here to help support the community in it's growth and long term sustainability. It is important to note however that:</p>
<blockquote>The Drupal Association has no say in either the planning or development of the Drupal open source project itself.</blockquote>
<p>For those with questions, please feel free to read more <a href="http://association.drupal.org/about">about us</a> and check out the <a href="http://association.drupal.org/about/faq">FAQ</a> and the <a href="http://association.drupal.org/about/statutes-and-internal-regulations">the statues and regulations</a>.</p>
<p>These are exciting times in the Drupal world, but there's still lots to do. Please <a href="http://association.drupal.org/donate">donate</a> and help us continue to grow!</p>
