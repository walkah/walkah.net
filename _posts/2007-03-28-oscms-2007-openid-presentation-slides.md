<p>Almost a week ago now (really?), I had a chance to present <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> to the attendees of the <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/">OSCMS Summit 2007</a>. I think it went fairly well based on the feedback I received (at least what folks were willing to say to my face). Those of you who have seen <a href="http://identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/">Dick Hardt</a> present will recognize the presentation style - and the inspiration - for which I am grateful. Hopefully, it offered a good introduction to digital identity for the folks who have huge potential to influence adoption of OpenID - namely the authors of open source content management systems.</p>
<p>Slides are attached. Thanks to everyone who attended!</p>
