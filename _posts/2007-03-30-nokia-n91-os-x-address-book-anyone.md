<p>OK. This might seem silly, but I *really* want my n91 to pair with the Mac OS X address book. Why? Because this would allow me to send and receive SMS messages without picking up my phone, as well as making calls. Trust me, it's a nice feature - especially since the n91 has a nice charging cradle where I could just set it and leave it. Sadly, it appears it <a href="http://n91mac.wordpress.com/2006/05/03/apple-and-the-n91-issues/">just doesn't work</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like these <a href="http://www.novamedia.de/e_pages/e_produkte_mac_ab_plugin.html">Address Book Phone Plugins</a> from Nova Media claim to fix the problem. However, they want my hard earned money before I can even try to see if it works with my phone. Can anyone confirm that they work with the n91? Or should I just wing it? Are there other options?</p>
