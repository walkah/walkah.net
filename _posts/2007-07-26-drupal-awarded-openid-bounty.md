<p>OK, so I knew it was coming, but I'm super excited to announce that <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> was amongst the first 3 projects to be awarded the $5000 USD <a href="http://iwantmyopenid.org/bounty">bounty</a>. The award comes for the work I was involved in bringing <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/drupal-6-and-openid">OpenID support to Drupal 6</a>. Interestingly, Drupal was the only PHP-based application awarded in this initial round, the other two being <a href="http://plone.org/">Plone</a> (written in Python) and <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/">DotNetNuke</a> (written in VB.NET).</p>
<p>Before you start asking me for a beer, the money is being sent directly to the <a href="http://association.drupal.org/">Drupal Association</a>. :)</p>
<p>Thank you to the OpenID Foundation, specifically <a href="http://kveton.com/blog/">Scott Kveton</a>, for putting together the bounty. And thanks to everyone in the Drupal community for continuing to be on the front-end of new technologies.</p>
