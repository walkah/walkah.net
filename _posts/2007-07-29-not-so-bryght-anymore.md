<p>File this one under things-i-should-have-blogged-weeks-ago, but it's been brought to my attention that perhaps I should say something "official":</p>
<p>I have left <a href="http://www.bryght.com/">Bryght</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, it's true... after three years with the company I co-founded - the first <a href="http://drupal.org/">drupal</a> company - I am moving on.</p>
<p>There is little gossip involved, I'm sorry to report. Bryght has a <a href="http://bryght.com/about/the-team">great team</a> full of some of the smartest people in the drupal community... good friends and people I love and respect. They're also up to some <a href="http://drupal.org/node/162162">very cool stuff</a>. Sometimes, though, we all just need a change of scenery.</p>
<p>So to answer the common questions: yes, I'll still be (hopefully even more) actively involved in the Drupal community; yes, you did read/see/hear me involved in that; yes, I agree that's an interesting sounding project; no, I probably don't have time to help you with it right now.</p>
<p>Here's to what lies ahead.</p>
