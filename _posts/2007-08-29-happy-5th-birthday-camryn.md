<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1150/1217848261_61198a9c8a_m.jpg" alt="camryn ear's pierced" class="right" />I've always had a thing about significant numbers - <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/happy-07-07-07">07/07/07</a>, <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/thirty">my 30th birthday</a>, etc - today's significant number is 5. My "baby" girl, Camryn, turned 5 today. Her ears are pierced, she rides a two-wheeler, and starts kindergarten in less than a week. My baby isn't so much a baby anymore...</p>
<p>Camryn, you are the sweetest girl in the whole wide world, and I love you with my whole heart. Happy Birthday! Now, if you could only read and your dad would let you use his computer...</p>
