<p>I was contacted last week by <a href="http://serialconsign.com/">Greg J. Smith</a> to do a little interview for a piece he was doing for the <a href="http://torontoist.com/">Torontoist</a> about the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/toronto">Toronto Drupal User Group</a>. I just got word that <a href="http://torontoist.com/2007/08/community_build.php">the post is up</a>! Thanks for the coverage, Greg! Hope to see a ton of new faces this month :)
