<p>In the name of posterity, I thought I'd try to capture one of those funny moments with kids... you know, the kind of thing a real blogger would do. Here goes:</p>
<p>Last weekend, the kids and I had some errands to run so we headed out in the car. As if I needed another reminder that I just don't enjoy living in the suburbs... there was an anti-abortion / pro-life rally happening at the major intersection outside of my subdivision. The predominant sign amongst the crowd (which had manned all four corners) read "Abortion kills children". I grumbled as I waited for the light to turn - expecting to have to explain the signs. As the light turned green and we drove away, Andrew said to me:</p>
<p>"Dad, those people were crazy! They had signs that said 'Addition kills children'!"</p>
<p>I love you, Andrew.</p>
