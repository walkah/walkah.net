<p>I finally made it out to another <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCamp">DemoCampToronto</a> last night (my first since presenting back at <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/openid-democamptoronto13">DemoCampToronto13</a>) and my first at the <a href="http://www.bot.com/">Toronto Board of Trade</a>. I have to say, I'm continually amazed at how these events have continued to grow. Major congrats to the "stewards" (c'mon, guys, you're the organizers ... really) : <a href="http://www.davidcrow.ca/">David</a>, <a href="http://www.radiantcore.com/">Jay</a>, <a href="http://www.joeydevilla.com/">Joey</a>, <a href="http://ideeinc.com/">Leila</a> and <a href="http://third-bit.com/blog/">Greg</a>.</p>
<p>That said, the character of the event sure has changed... grown up? Sold out? Not sure. They're certainly *big*. There's lots of time spent on the sponsors (who's generosity I don't mean to belittle). There's little time for questions to the demo'ers. Few of the new people stuck around for drinks after the event <em>and</em> there were people in suits!?! Maybe I'm crazy, but perhaps the disruptive, un-conference events need to get disrupted?</p>
<p>There were some interesting demos/talks last night. My highlights were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.slashid.com/">SlashID</a> : nice to see another Canadian identity startup. I have to admit, their demo wasn't great, but talking with Zeev afterwards was interesting. They took some pot-shots at <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> which made for good debate. Enough to warrant a post of it's own... to be continued...</li>
<li><a href="http://www.shapeshop3d.com/">ShapeShop</a> (Ryan Schmidt) has a pretty awesome looking 3d modeling tool and was able to at least bring a laugh or two to otherwise well-behaved crowd.</li>
<li><a href="http://remarkk.com/">Mark Kuznicki</a>: *rocked* the ignite format with <a href="http://remarkk.com/2007/12/04/cocreating-the-creative-city-ignite-democamp/">Co-creating the Creative City</a>. Good timing and good execution on a topic heavily laden in it's own jargon. I encourage you to check out his slides for all the missing info he wasn't able to get into his allotted 15 seconds per slide!</li>
</ul>
<p>I will say, it was great to see everyone and it was really nice to not have to drive home afterwards ;) See y'all again in January (I hope).</p>
