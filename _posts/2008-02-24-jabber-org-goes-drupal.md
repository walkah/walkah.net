<p><img src="http://walkah.net/sites/walkah.net/files/jabber.png" alt="jabber.org" class="left" />Picking through my email and RSS on a Sunday afternoon, I noticed that <a href="http://jabber.org/">jabber.org</a> has finally <a href="http://www.jabber.org/node/305">relaunched using Drupal</a>! I think this is exciting, as it brings together two of my favourite technologies.</p>
<p>I've been peripherally involved in the XSF/jabber.org Drupal initiatives for a few years now. While I wasn't as closely involved in this site launch as I'd hoped to be (due to time constraints), they've definitely got my support and I hope to help this initiative continue to grow!</p>
<p>Congrats <a href=http://stpeter.im/">Peter</a> and team!</p>
