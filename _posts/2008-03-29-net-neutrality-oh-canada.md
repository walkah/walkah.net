<p>Dear Canada, you're doing it all wrong!</p>

<p>OK, so I love my adopted nation. I do. But, what's a guy (or gal) got to do to get affordable, unmolested bandwidth in this country?!?</p>

<p>I've <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/wireless-rates-canada">written before</a> about the abysmal mobile data situation in this country. Canada has <em>one</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM">GSM</a> network - and we pay the price for it.</p>

<p>But, until recently, my internets were safe at home. See, I'm a very happy subscriber of <a href="http://www.teksavvy.com/">TekSavvy</a> residential DSL: clean, clear, reliable, affordable bandwidth. Well, that's until Canada's <a href="http://bell.ca/home/">copper monopoly</a> decided to start <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Bell-Canada-Confirms-Throttling-92973">throttling my bandwidth</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://ambermac.com/articles/2008/03/26/save-teksavvy-freeourbandwidth-com">People</a> have been <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/torcamp/browse_thread/thread/41b043975a2cc3e0">talking</a> and <a href="http://remarkk.com/2008/03/29/bell-canada-hands-net-neutrality-advocates-a-gift/">blogging</a> about the events. You can follow the events at <a href="http://www.freeourbandwidth.com/">Free Our Bandwidth</a> and, if you haven't before, read more about <a href="http://www.neutrality.ca/">net neutrality</a>. It's time for some real change. <a href="http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/welcome.htm">CRTC</a>, where are you???</p>

<p>Canada, I'm fed up. Oh, and <a href="http://www.humptydumpty.com/prodline/prod_ketchupchips.htm">ketchup chips</a> suck too.</p>
