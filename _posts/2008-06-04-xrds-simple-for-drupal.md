<p>Last night I put together a simple module for Drupal to implement the <a href="http://xrds-simple.net/core/1.0/">XRDS-Simple</a> spec. It is based loosely on the <a href="http://singpolyma.net/plugins/xrds-simple/">xrds-simple wordpress plugin</a>.</p>

<p>XRDS-Simple is an important piece of the <a href="http://diso-project.org/">DiSo project</a>. From <a href="http://xrds-simple.net/core/1.0/">the XRDS-Simple spec:</a>:</p>
<blockquote>XRDS-Simple provides a format and workflow for the discovery of resources metadata, and other linked resources. As web services continue to grow, applications utilize a wider range of web services and resources across multiple providers. XRDS-Simple allows providers to document their resources in a machine-readable way, which can be automatically discovered by consumer applications.</blockquote>
<p>So, check it out: http://drupal.org/project/xrds_simple .</p>
