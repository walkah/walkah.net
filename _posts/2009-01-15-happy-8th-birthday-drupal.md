Man, we're getting old!

Today (January 15th) is the 8th anniversary of the day Drupal 1.0 was released. Although [Dries](http://buytaert.net/) had no idea at the time - it was a move that would not only change his life, but mine too...

January 2009 also marks the 5th anniversary of my starting to work on Drupal full time (after a few years of "hobby" involvement). My first project (at the time, actually a re-launch) still stands as one of my favourites: http://www.terminus1525.ca/ . Since then, Drupal has defined my career: from co-founding [Bryght](http://www.bryght.com/) to my current life as a [Lullabot](http://www.lullabot.com/). The community is home to some of [my best friends](http://www.lullabot.com/about/team) and people [I love](http://www.lizakindred.com/). 

Five years - full-time. No wonder [I feel old](http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/why-i-hate-drupal).
