In just a few days, most of the [drupal community](http://drupal.org/) will be headed to Washington, DC for [DrupalCon](http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/). As the conference draws closer, I always get excited to see friends I don't get to see and share exciting ideas, but this time there is a lot of growing interest and activity around [OpenID](http://openid.net/).

As has become a bit of a tradition, I'll be giving my 4th [OpenID talk](http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/openid-drupal-and-open-web). This year, I'm hoping to focus a bit on the exciting new developments from the OpenID community and looking at some of the things being built on top of OpenID (like the [OpenID/OAuth hybrid model](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/comcast_property_sees_92_success_rate_openid.php) and the [DiSo project](http://diso-project.org/)).

Also, [Chris Messina](http://factoryjoe.com/) will be one of the keynote presenters - also talking about [online identity](http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/node/4222). We had Chris on the [lullabot podcast](http://www.lullabot.com/audiocast/podcast-71-chris-messina-and-open-identity) this week - be sure to check it out!

Finally, for those of you coming to DC - I'm going to round up interested parties on Saturday for an [OpenID code sprint](http://groups.drupal.org/node/19529). Hope to see you there!
