Calling all social web "hackers"! I've been asked to help put together an awesome event:

[Change Medium Toronto](http://changemedium.org/)

If you love hacking on emerging technologies and recognize the effect they're having on society. I'm talking about things like [Activity Streams](http://activitystrea.ms/), [OpenMicroBlogging](http://openmicroblogging.org/), and [PubSubHubbub](http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/). We'll be looking at the latest microblogging and real-time web technologies - with the very simple goal of building something new.

The truly awesome [Evan Prodromou](http://identi.ca/evan) will be there representing [StatusNet](http://status.net/). You should join us too.

Toronto, let's get our geek on and make stuff! [Sign up here](http://bit.ly/cmTorontoInvite) - and I will see you there!
