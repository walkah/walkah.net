For the unfamiliar, StatusNet Inc is the company behind the StatusNet open source micro messaging platform. 

I think StatusNet is a very interesting project and one I've been following for a long time. It's a true Open Source project that seems to be a perfect storm of technologies that interest me and a commitment to openness that I admire. 

What really excites me about StatusNet, though, is challenge of federation. StatusNet installs currently ship with an implementation of a protocol known as [OpenMicroBlogging](http://openmicroblogging.org/). This means that you (or your company / organization or book club) can have your own real-time, micro messaging site (read: your own twitter) and if there's someone not on your site you'd like to follow, you can do so without having to register (and monitor) multiple sites. 

We're currently planning a major update to the protocol to take advantage of some of the exciting new stuff like [PubSubHubbub](http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/) and [ActivityStreams](http://activitystrea.ms/). I'm excited to get to work on the protocol and implementation *and* tell you all about it :-)
